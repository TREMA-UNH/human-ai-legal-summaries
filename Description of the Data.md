## Description of the Data



The facts.jsonl.gz is a collection of structured Q&A exchanges extracted from deposition transcripts, stored in JSON Lines (.jsonl) format. Each line is a JSON object (fact) representing a single question-answer pair between a questioner (typically an attorney) and a witness.

Fields:

`question` / `answer`: Raw transcript text of the question and answer.

`question_sa` / `answer_sa`: Speaker-attributed versions, explicitly tagging who said that.

`sentence`: A narrative third-person view sentence generated based on each Q&A pair, making the pronouns explicit and keeping the important parts of the Q&A pair. This sentence is generated by prompting the LLM.

`conversation`: Names of the speaker roles (Q_SPEAKER, A_SPEAKER).

`page_number` / `line_number`: Location metadata from the original transcript.

`topic` / `other_info`: Reserved for topic modeling and or any other piece of information to add.
